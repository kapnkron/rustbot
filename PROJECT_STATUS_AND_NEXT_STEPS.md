# Project Beatrice: Solana Trading Bot - Status and Next Steps

**Date:** June 8, 2025

## üéØ Current Goal:
Integrate a Python-based Machine Learning (ML) pipeline with a Rust core for a Solana trading bot, enabling the Rust core to fetch predictions from a Python API.

## ‚úÖ Recent Accomplishments (Focus: Pipeline Robustness, Data Integrity, and Compatibility):

1. **Signature Conversion Bug Fixed:**
   * The critical Python 3.12 compatibility issue with Solana's `get_signatures_for_address` ("argument 'before': 'RpcSignaturesForAddressConfig' object cannot be converted to 'Signature'") is now fully resolved. The code now uses the correct API signature and passes `before` and `limit` as keyword arguments, not as a config object.
   * The pipeline now runs without this error.
2. **Pipeline Cleanup:**
   * All redundant/legacy shell scripts and Python scripts (old pipeline runners, DEXTools/Helius test scripts, etc.) have been removed for clarity and maintainability.
   * The only entry point for the full pipeline is now `./run_fixed_pipeline_py312.sh`.
3. **Sentiment Data Integrity:**
   * All synthetic/fake sentiment data and code have been removed. The pipeline now only uses real sentiment data (from Twitter or other sources) and will not generate or use synthetic values if data is missing.
   * The sentiment step runs in a dedicated Python 3.11 venv to maintain compatibility with snscrape and related tools.
4. **Liquidity Threshold Increased:**
   * The minimum liquidity for viable pools is now $10,000 (was $1,000). This is enforced in `scripts/fetch_pool_addresses.py`.
5. **Rate Limit Handling Improved:**
   * A 2-second delay is now inserted between fetching top tokens and filtering for viable pools to avoid rate limiting issues.
6. **General Codebase Hygiene:**
   * All old, unused, or redundant scripts (including those for DEXTools, Helius, and synthetic data generation) have been deleted.

## üöß Current Known Issues:

- **New Error:**
  * `'solders.transaction_status.EncodedConfirmedTransactionWithStatusMeta' object is not subscriptable` appears during trade processing. This is unrelated to the previous signature bug and will be fixed after the current pipeline run completes.

## üöÄ Immediate Next Steps:

1. **Fix Transaction Object Subscriptability Error:**
   * Update trade processing logic to use attribute access (e.g., `obj.field`) instead of subscript access (e.g., `obj['field']`) for Solders transaction objects.
2. **Verify End-to-End Pipeline:**
   * Ensure the pipeline runs from start to finish, including real sentiment collection, pool filtering, OHLCV fetching, feature engineering, and model training.
3. **Continue Rust Integration:**
   * Integrate predictions into the Rust bot logic as described in previous steps.
4. **Automate ML Artifact Management:**
   * Implement symlink or manifest-based artifact management for seamless model updates.
5. **General Codebase Hygiene:**
   * Continue to remove or refactor any remaining legacy or redundant code as discovered.

## ‚è≥ Future/Blocked Tasks:

* Full implementation of `TradingBot` logic beyond basic prediction fetching.
* Telegram bot integration and dashboard functionality (currently mostly commented out).
* Advanced error handling, monitoring, and alerting.
* Database integration for trade logging, performance tracking, etc.

**Note:**
- The pipeline is now robust against Python 3.12/Solana compatibility issues and only uses real data for all financial modeling. The next priority is to fix the new Solders transaction object error and continue with end-to-end validation and integration.
